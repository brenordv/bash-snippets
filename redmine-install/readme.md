# Install Redmine using Docker

This is a convenience script to install Redmine in a Ubuntu system using Docker.

## Getting Started

This script will install docker, docker-compose and then will install latest version of Redmine with it's default settings.
It's far from a perfect script, but works fine on Ubuntu 16.x+

```
sudo chmod +x ./install_redmine_docker.sh
```

### How to use

Just run the script...

```
sudo ./install_redmine_docker.sh
```
